# Masters-Preparation  
A repository for learning some practical mathematics for the fulfillment of Masters Requirements.  

## Projects  
1. **SecurePacketAnalyzer**: An implementation of Radix Sort for security analysis for network packets  
   - **Key Skills**: Analysis of complexity, input checking, radix sorting algorithms  
   - [Code](radix_sort_analyzer.py)  

2. **Security Protocol Model Checker**: Security protocol verification via Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Büchi automata  
   - **Key Skills:** Formal methods (automata, temporal logic), security, research alignment  
   - [Code](Checker/model_checker.py)  

## Self-Study Summaries  
- **Discrete Mathematics**: Truth tables, induction, proofs  
- **Automata Theory**: DFA/NFA design, applied to network intrusion detection ([example](self_study_summary.md))  
- **Formal Methods**: Linear-Time Logic (LTL) and Büchi automata, their application to protocol verification ([details](formal_methods_summary.md))  
- **Algorithms**: Graph traversals, sorting, analysis of complexity
